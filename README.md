# Another World mini-ARG Archive
In my Project Arrhythmia custom level In The Tiger's Den, I left behind a few hidden links to different sites you could dig through a bit more to find hidden lore details. One of them was hosted on Glitch, which unfortunately shut down.

This repository is an attempmt to preserve the original version of the site with Github Pages. A hint: use inspect element to find more stuff.

If you just want to read the stuff I wrote for this, I have all of the text [uploaded to Toyhouse.](https://toyhou.se/~literature/232252.logs-from-another-world)
