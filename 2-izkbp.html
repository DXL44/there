    [1]: So, if I'm looking at this correctly, this "Sphere" of yours should protect us.
     <br>
     [2]: Yes. That's the goal. Protection for all! Our planet will be immovable against any threat.
     <br>
     [3]: I must say...the costs of it are a bit concerning.
     <br>
     [3]: And don't you think that you're asking too much of [1] here? The amount of his power he'd have to give up is immense.
     <br>
     [1]: I don't care about that! If this is for the good of all, I'm in.
     <br>
     [2]: I like that enthusiasm. 
     <br>
     [3]: [2]...I'm not sure about this one though. Wouldn't this be more of a prison than a protection?
     <br>
     [2]: It goes equal either way.
