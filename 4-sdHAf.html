      [Excerpt]<br />
      The Navigator Stars are suppousedly a race of sentient celestial beings that roam the
      skies above many different worlds. They seemingly exist only as a legend, as
      nobody has documented seeing one. The stars were used as the first form of
      navigation, and the Navigator Stars (hence their name) are no different.
      They exist to guide heroes to save worlds in danger, and its up to them to
      pick the right person for the job. Do they exist? Nobody knows, but its likely 
      that the multiverse would be a much worse place if they
      didn't. My bets are on the fact that they do exist, and possibly are still
      sending heroes to this day.
