    [1]: So, if I'm looking at this correctly, this "Sphere" of yours should protect us.
     <br>
     [2]: Yes. That's the goal. Protection for all! Our planet will be immovable against any threat.
     <br>
     [3]: I must say...the costs of it are a bit concerning.
     <br>
     [3]: And don't you think that you're asking too much of [1] here? The amount of his power he'd have to give up is immense.
     <br>
     [1]: I don't care about that! If this is for the good of all, I'm in.
     <br>
     [2]: I like that enthusiasm. 
<br>
     [2]: Now...let's discuss royalty costs, shall we?
     <br>
     [3]: Royalty costs?
     <br>
     [2]: Yes. This is a buisness proposition after all. I'm not handing you my technology for free.
     <br>
     [1]: I thought this was a force for good, not greed.
     <br>
     [2]: Well I gotta make a buck somehow. My previous projects haven't been all too successful.
     <br>
     [1]: That's because your previous projects were unethical, dangerous, and bad in many other ways!
     <br>
     [2]: Debateable. My antimatter research has reached several breakthroughs. And the AI experiments have progressed further than imaginable.
     <br>
     [3]: [1]...Its just buisness. I'll pay for it, and its deserved. 
     <br>
     [2]: THANK YOU.
     <br>
     [2]: Okay...let's get started...
