      …the Dagger is pretty much all I’ve got to protect me from myself now. I
      have no clue how it even DOES that thing it does, but it works better than
      everything I’ve tried myself…

      ...had a breakthrough with the Armor! I finally got it to work. This
      should make the hyper energy a lot easier to contain when it needs to be,
      and offers a ton of protection with some power. It also looks pretty
      frickin cool...

      I'm getting bored of this. Where’s the adventure? The great mission? The
      uh...anything?... I have this power, and nothing happens that lets me use
      it. That sucks. Then again, sometimes I wonder if that's for the best.
      After all, I barely understand it myself.
