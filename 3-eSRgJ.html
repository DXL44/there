      I can't believe it - they kicked me off. They kicked me off the team
      working on the Sphere. And STOLE MY WORK.<br />
      It became clear to me pretty fast that the idiot in charge wanted to use
      this as a prison, not a procetion. His green friend is completely clueless
      to this and is blinded by the thought of the heroic sacrifice. I couldn't
      get the real point of the Sphere through to them.<br />
      They threatened to activate it if I started on any dangerous projects as a
      response to my departure. That shows they see me as a threat to other
      worlds beyond this one. I like that feeling, they sure as hell better be
      scared.<br />
      Its clear that this world shouldn't be run the way it is. So I'm going to
      take it back. There are many different sources of <i>power</i> here, yet
      nobody has decided to take them all into their own hands. With my plan,
      I'll collect power from not only this planet, but another world as
      well.<br />
      Tomorrow I will restart the antimatter project, to try and see what I can
      make of it. I'll also set up a trap for one certain individual I have had
      my eye on the power of for a while...someone who is letting their power
      foolishly go to waste.

      Everything that could go wrong...did go wrong. For starters, the Sphere
      was activated as I barely got started on the Anitmatter projcet. Then,
      this stupid square thing ("Hal" it was called?) came out of ABSOLUTELY
      NOWHERE, DISTRACTED MY TARGET, AND MADE THE TRAP USELESS. And the icing on
      this absolutely terrible cake is that the antimatter portal was activated
      again - not by me, but COMPLETELY ACCIDENTALLY by this "Hal". They
      summoned some sort of...antimatter version of themself. <br />
      "Hal" may not know it yet...but they've made a new enemy.

      There has been good news on the Antimatter. I was able to summon the
      strange creature born from it back to my lab, and managed to...kind of
      train it. I got across to it that I was the reason it was here, and that I
      could get it back home if it helped me out with my projects. I...actually
      can't get it home yet. But once I gain enough strength, nothing will be
      impossible, so I don't see why I won't be able to. I don't want to make an
      empty promise, after all. The poor creature is probably confused out of
      its mind. <br />
      In the meantime, I've dispacted a freelance contractor to take care of
      Hal. Knowing their history, they should perform well with their focus.
